                    We're gonna go ahead and do a video
                    announcing your swing so since I think
                    it's time I like to be lesson so far so
                    I think it's time for us to do a video
                    analysis your swing to see the great
                    improvement you've made so far and what
                    other things that need to continue to
                    work on so that you can continue to
                    improve your game okay so let's begin
                    shall we
                    first we're gonna draw some lines right
                    here so this is a line on your on your
                    back side so I think the first time I
                    met you we work in a rotation right but
                    even with good rotation we need to make
                    sure the fundamentals are good because
                    if our balance is incorrect if we're not
                    staying in our posture our body angles
                    are not correct then no matter how hard
                    you try to turn how hard you try to have
                    faith have your body face a target when
                    you hit the ball right it's not gonna
                    happen at maximum and you're not gonna
                    hitting the center the clubface and the
                    path of the club is not gonna be Ryan
                    you're gonna keep hitting like slices
                    and all that stuff right so as you can
                    see before you're always going off the
                    line you see that so and that's just
                    because of your hips so or two things
                    because again we talked about you have
                    to focus on your hips right and your if
                    we look right here your your weight
                    right the weight of your legs are you
                    can stand more weight on your toes or on
                    your hip on your heels right so before
                    you always win forward like crazy with
                    your toes and your hips in the backswing
                    but now we've kept that more under
                    control now as you can see right here
                    right boom we're staying right on it
                    because your hips are now as you can see
                    right here it's going more backwards
                    right and in your legs as well or your
                    feet the weight of your feet and legs
                    are also going more backwards it's good
                    so we trying to want to feel like a
                    pulling back motion of both the hips and
                    the legs right because if we don't do
                    that we have no shot in the downswing if
                    our bastings not good we're gonna it's
                    already ruined our downswing right so
                    but it seems like you're doing pretty
                    good there so a good job okay now on the
                    downswing again much better you see that
                    your
                    not as much not as much before like like
                    you're like moving forward a lot right
                    not as much as before but it's still
                    you're good you're good you're good
                    and then weight on toes so now you need
                    to of course to focus on your back
                    muscles making sure that it's getting
                    that answer to making sure you're using
                    your back muscles like we said having
                    your butt go back but it's also the
                    weight of your toes - of your feet is
                    going in your toes so you can see you're
                    good you're good you're hit and then
                    BOOM wrong wrong wrong so that's going
                    your toes going your toes so we're gonna
                    need some key need to work on that okay
                    so I feel like that's something that you
                    still really struggle on because if you
                    look at somebody like like Dustin
                    Johnson here right so we're gonna go
                    ahead and we're gonna go to Dustin
                    Johnson's driver swing so this guy you
                    know his number on the world two-time
                    major winner should have probably one
                    more
                    we had a better short game but if you
                    look in here in his transition phase of
                    the downswing it's straight straight
                    down straight down his he's not going
                    towards his toes he's more grand tourers
                    heels actually see that another thing
                    too you can see is that in his as he
                    goes into his backswing to downswing his
                    legs don't over bend because again look
                    at this this circle right here you see
                    that your your feet are lifting up
                    already here your right foot is lifting
                    up like crazy prematurely too too soon
                    and then also you look at right here to
                    your your left heel let's look at more
                    your left he left and that's more
                    troubling so you see that it's super up
                    like crazy you see doesn't Johnson's
                    it's planted on the ground if anything
                    his toes going up
                    you see his tail going up I'm sure let's
                    see that right there his toes going up
                    which is good making sure it he we know
                    that he's close to actually going a
                    little up so it you can see that it's
                    the opposite your heels going up right
                    so it just shows us that you know your
                    legs are bending your heels coming up
                    that just means that your waiting is
                    really off okay
                    compared to Dustin Johnson which is why
                    you're still standing up and why you're
                    also still um hitting outside to in so
                    what did I mean by outside in by the
                    time you get close to the ball see that
                    it's still coming outside but better
                    than before better than before though
                    you see that so um you look closer hope
                    I just had it there you go
                    right better than before you can see the
                    left look at where that Club is this
                    super outside man like if this is our
                    target line right we're trying to go
                    straight this way that's around your
                    target line around this is around your
                    target line right here right your claw
                    face is going like
                    this way see that this is even going
                    more so at least we that helped a little
                    bit like as you can see it's not as
                    outside this thing is much less outside
                    then here so that's good outside meaning
                    that if it's outside all right what is
                    the ball gonna do the ball is gonna go
                    left start left and then come back if
                    you're lucky right if you're lucky it
                    will come back and then slice or fade
                    right so we want in the future we just
                    want to go straight and if you want to
                    fade and draw it'll go straight and then
                    fade or draw depending on what you want
                    but work well that's a little more in
                    the future okay but the bodies to start
                    off straight okay
                    you can't start on the left or you're
                    gonna get in big trouble super confused
                    you need to always aim too much to the
                    right and have the ball go left and fade
                    or something on you okay so we're gonna
                    keep working on that and again that's
                    mostly because of your weighting is
                    wrong and also because of your arms is
                    what we're actually gonna work on next
                    so if we can look on the right here look
                    at where your arm position as compared
                    to Dustin Johnson's it's so different
                    you see that these keeping you very
                    close to his body there's a reason for
                    that and we're gonna need to work on
                    that that's more of the arm plane
                    working on the arms and the golf swing
                    but luckily in my opinion that's easier
                    to fix so let's go ahead and just fix
                    we're gonna try to cut you know work on
                    making sure our body angles are correct
                    by making sure back muscles are correct
                    our posture is good and also what you
                    need to continue to work on is our
                    waiting right which is why we're gonna
                    really try to emphasize next time we
                    worked together but again
                    make sure that the weighting is good so
                    that we can work on this arm thing
                    because see see arms they're still
                    really outside if we can fix this arm
                    thing and then also fix the the weight
                    making sure it's not always going on our
                    toes toes toes in the you know beginning
                    the downswing
                    and I promise you that ball is gonna go
                    straight down the middle okay and you'll
                    hit it not just straighter but farther
                    right which is right below one right so
                    you have your questions go ahead and you
                    can ask me for your dad and yeah have a
                    great day and hope to see you soon good
                    luck with everything</div>

                    Hi Mandy I hope you had a great weekend
                    I just wanted to give you a video
                    summary of our last lesson gonna it's
                    gonna talk about all the things that we
                    worked on two things we worked on some
                    things that you do really well during
                    lesson and some things that you need to
                    continue to work on I know that this is
                    your first time in golf you don't really
                    have golf clubs and were any golf range
                    golf ball membership and stuff so I
                    think for now it's best to just think
                    about it keep keep all the things that
                    we learn in mind and maybe do some
                    practice swings at at home preferably
                    outside because you don't want to damage
                    any furniture I have certainly done that
                    before so watch out you know golf clubs
                    can be uh yeah I can hurt furniture so
                    yeah we're gonna go ahead and start
                    right now so the first thing we worked
                    on was the upper body so this is the
                    upper body right here okay so I'm gonna
                    draw two lines right here so and just to
                    let you know this is left as before this
                    is after okay so before after so so the
                    first thing we worked on it was keeping
                    the upper body more stable not moving up
                    and down so much you know that's that's
                    something that we really worked on in
                    and the reason why it's important is
                    because when we do that when if we go up
                    then we have to come down and we have to
                    we do that's chopping motion so let's
                    see so go ahead and look at the left
                    video right here okay so you're going up
                    so you're going up right now alright so
                    if you can just actually let's just add
                    a line right here so you're going up you
                    see that so you're going up and if we
                    draw some new lines right here you can
                    see the difference right here look at
                    the difference in the spine angles see
                    that so it totally changed so your head
                    going up and your heads going up because
                    your upper body which is drawn but with
                    the blue lines so that's not good
                    because what happens is like we do that
                    then you have to come down okay so once
                    once you go up you have to come down so
                    let's see it so you're going up right
                    here and now you got to go down and yeah
                    so that's not very good so first we
                    started here right you start on the red
                    line you went up you everybody went up
                    and now you
                    go down you gotta chop at the ball hey
                    that's like that you're like a hammer
                    okay so you're you're hammering the ball
                    you're having the ball down which is
                    indicated by this blue arrow you're
                    hammering the ball down okay so that's
                    not good here but we look at the right
                    picture right here right so this is what
                    we worked on after and you did a really
                    great job at this you you were able to
                    do it right away so which is really good
                    and so let's go ahead and draw the same
                    lines so when you take it back boom
                    you're keeping those angles see that
                    it's parallel it's pretty much didn't
                    change and also look at the blue line
                    that's great you see the difference
                    right there between the two swings right
                    here huge difference huge difference you
                    see that and when you're coming down
                    then you can maintain it and look how
                    much you're turning more - we didn't
                    really talk about this yet but as you
                    can see on this swing right here right
                    you can really see this this um your
                    your back side more so you can really
                    see your back side up as opposed to this
                    see that you're not really turning as
                    much so really you're using when you do
                    this you give yourself you keep yourself
                    the opportunity to really turn and use
                    your body use your whole entire body
                    right for you you're just using your
                    arms here you're not turning so you're
                    not you're not turning this way you're
                    just you're just using your arms so
                    there's you can see that's a big
                    difference like you can really see that
                    it's this part or your shirt right you
                    can see this part you can barely see
                    that part you can see it here so that's
                    because you're turning much more which
                    is good right
                    so that's because that of what we worked
                    on the second thing
                    okay so the second thing that we worked
                    on was trying to get that left arm more
                    straight okay so the problem was is that
                    is that you're you're coming down you
                    actually have a really good position
                    here this is what we call lag in the cop
                    sync so what that means like you're
                    keeping this angle so sometimes the the
                    more the less angle that we have like
                    this angle would not be good all right
                    90 degrees so the more acute the more
                    narrow and go that we have is good which
                    is what you have right here on the right
                    we have Michelle we should depression
                    offer so she's a really good boss
                    wrecker well she was kind of wandering a
                    little bit but overall pretty good swing
                    okay so as you can see both of you guys
                    do a lot of similar things look at this
                    very similar right here that's what I
                    that's what I meant by like when you
                    when uh in the beginning of the lesson I
                    was like wow you actually do this really
                    well naturally so that's very good the
                    problem is like right here so as we come
                    right here I you don't maintain it so
                    you're good here you're good here and
                    then you kind of let go
                    as you can see Michelle we're I she
                    maintains it much better she's able to
                    maintain it for you you kind of you
                    don't maintain it as well in that arm it
                    starts to look at the left arm you see
                    that he starts to fold up a little bit
                    so this is even after that we worked on
                    the left about the left arm and then
                    look at me show look how much he holds
                    on the onto the arm after this shot so
                    you can see that right you can see the
                    difference right there you're folding
                    this arm right here you're folding this
                    arm she is straining that arm she's
                    maintaining it she's holding that making
                    it more stable this one here is gonna
                    make crank weak shots so those
                    are the two things we worked on okay so
                    just make sure you so um so continue to
                    work on that work we brushed up on that
                    a little bit during the lesson but we're
                    going to continue to work on that so
                    again this is good really good here
                    really good really good and then boom
                    not so good right so that's that's right
                    here is is what we're working on is
                    getting that left arm it's a much more
                    stable position like Michelle we like
                    that see that so so but I'm very um it's
                    very good first lesson so far and uh
                    yeah if you have any questions don't be
